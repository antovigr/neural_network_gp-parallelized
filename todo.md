- [x] Rename sigma function sigmoid
- [x] Clean useless #include
- [x] Write good headers (hpp)
- [ ] Install code formater
- [ ] Install libraries sorting tool
- [ ] Check memory leaks
- [x] Do not include .cpp files
- [ ] Overcharge the fit() method in Autoencoder instead of defining it
- [ ] Free allocated memory in the destructor of GradientDescent
- [ ] Use unidimentional cuda grids when possible for coalesced access


- [ ] Is it better pratice to malloc at each forward pass or once in the constructor and reuse the same memory ? In term of computation time and reliability ?
- [ ] Better use cuda libraries or create our own kernels ?
